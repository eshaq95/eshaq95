## Additional Resources
- [MATLAB Projects](https://github.com/eshaq95/MATLAB-projects): Collection of MATLAB codes for engineering applications, including turbine blade optimization and numerical solutions for PDEs
- [MOOC Certificates](https://github.com/eshaq95/MOOC-certificates): Repository of completed online course certificates
- [AI Wealth Builder (Experiment on Cursor)](https://github.com/eshaq95/ai-wealth-builder) is a full-stack financial management platform built with Next.js 13, TypeScript, and FastAPI. It features portfolio analytics, budget management, and transaction analysis with real-time data visualization. This has not been coded by me; it is an automated project using Cursor for learning how to use Cursor. The code is AI-generated.
