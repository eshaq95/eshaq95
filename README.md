# Eshaq Rahmani  
**Data Science Graduate | MSc in Data Science and Analytics**

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a data scientist with a focus on solving real-world problems using machine learning, predictive analytics, and clear data storytelling. With a strong background in engineering, software development, and applied statistics, I’ve worked on projects that help organizations make better decisions in finance, risk, operations, and customer targeting.

🔍 I specialize in:
- 📊 Data Science & Analytics (forecasting, segmentation, risk modeling)  
- 🤖 Machine Learning & AI (XGBoost, BERT, LSTM, SVM)  
- ☁️ Cloud & Big Data Tools (Hadoop, SQL, Docker)  
- 💡 Practical Problem Solving (turning data into action)

I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can use data to drive insight and impact — especially in finance, analytics, or data-driven product teams.

## 📌 Featured Projects (with Business Value)

### 🧠 Data Science

- [**Tesla Stock Analysis & Prediction (Dissertation)**](https://github.com/eshaq95/Tesla-Stock-Prediction-Analysis)  
  Compared 24,000+ technical trading strategies with ML models (LSTM, SVM) to evaluate performance on Tesla stock. Found ML models (esp. LSTM) offered superior returns in high-volatility periods — relevant for data-driven investors or algorithmic traders.

- [**Credit Risk Scorecard Development**](https://github.com/eshaq95/Credit-Risk-Scoring-Project)  
  Built scorecards using linear/logistic regression on German credit data. Enabled segmentation of high- vs low-risk applicants, helping banks improve loan decisions and reduce defaults.

- [**Time Series Forecasting for Ambulance Service**](https://github.com/eshaq95/Time-Series-Forecasting-Ambulance-Service-Calls)  
  Used multiple forecasting models (TBATS, ARIMA, Holt) to predict emergency call volumes for resource planning. Delivered scheduling recommendations based on demand peaks/trends.

- [**Text Categorization for 20 Newsgroups**](https://github.com/eshaq95/Text-Categorization-NLP-Newsgrouping)  
  Built NLP classification models (Naive Bayes, LSTM, CNN, BERT) to classify news articles. Demonstrated performance of traditional vs deep learning techniques on unstructured text.

- [**Car Insurance Prediction Project**](https://github.com/eshaq95/Car-Insurance-Prediction-ML)  
  Predicted customer interest in car insurance based on health insurance data. Helped simulate how insurers could improve cross-sell targeting with ML (XGBoost ROC-AUC: 0.775).

- [**Python Object Detection (Game Bot)**](https://github.com/eshaq95/RunescapeCV-MiningAI)  
  Used OpenCV and PyAutoGUI to automate in-game tasks using real-time object detection — personal project to explore computer vision and automation.

### 💻 Software Engineering

- [**Online Bookstore Website**](https://github.com/eshaq95/Online-Book-Store)  
  Full-stack e-commerce platform built with Java, SQL, HTML/CSS. Includes user management, checkout, and inventory features.

- [**Environmental Education Website for Kids**](https://github.com/eshaq95/GarbageSorting-WebGame)  
  Built an interactive JavaScript/HTML5 game for kids to learn waste sorting. Combines education with hands-on engagement.

- [**Online Movie Store** (Coming Soon)](https://github.com/eshaq95/Movie-store-restful-api)  
  RESTful full-stack web app for purchasing movies. Includes dynamic content loading (AJAX), SQL backend, and user account handling.

- [**C++ Particle Fire Simulation**](https://github.com/eshaq95/Particle_explosion_Project)  
  Built a real-time particle system using SDL2 in C++. Focus on graphics programming and simulation.
